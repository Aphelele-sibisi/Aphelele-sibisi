morse code is a method used in telecommunications to encode text characters as sequences of two different signals duration called dots and dashes

morse code was developed as a way to transmit messages over telegraph lines.it was developed to solve the problem this problem by using series of dot and dash to represent letters and numbers 

morse code is a system of encoding as a series of dot and dash that can be transmitted over a telegraph or other communication device.it work as follows:

each letter and number has a unique of sequence of dots and dash assigned to it,known as " code elements "
the operator uses a telegraph key to tap out the code elements with : 
A dot(.) represented by short mark ( usually a brief tap on the key)
A dash(-) represented by a long mark ( usually a slightly longer tap on the key)
the operator transmit the code elements in sequence with a short pause between each element 
the receiving operator listen to the sequence of dots and dash and translate them back into the original letter and number
